# PROFINET Usage Instructions

**English** | [**中文**](./README_zh.md)

## Introduction

PROFINET is an industrial Ethernet standard developed and promoted by PI (PROFIBUS and PROFINET International) and is widely used in the industrial automation field.

P-Net is an open-source PROFINET implementation, specifically designed for real-time network communication in embedded devices. It is a lightweight PROFINET protocol stack aimed at providing developers with a quick and efficient way to integrate PROFINET functionality into embedded platforms.

In this example, we will use the P-Net software package to implement PROFINET master-slave communication.

![image-20241217152754556](figures/image-20241217152754556.png)

![image-20241217153012620](figures/image-20241217153012620.png)

## PROFINET Slave Application Startup

Here we use the CODESYS software to test the interaction between the PN master and slave stations.

### LED Blinking

Back in the CODESYS software, in the left navigation panel, select `PN_Controller`, right-click and scan the devices. After clicking on the device name, click on "Blink LED":

![image-20241126114601251](figures/image-20241126114601251.png)

At this point, the development board (PN slave I/O) will display log outputs, accompanied by the onboard User LED blinking:

![img](figures/clip_image050.jpg)

### Modifying Slave I&M (Identification and Maintenance) Data

In the same device scanning interface, click on the I&M section in the lower left corner, modify the information, and write it to the I&M:

![image-20241209165958786](figures/image-20241209165958786.png)

At the same time, PNIO will update the slave station configuration:

![image-20241209170011069](figures/image-20241209170011069.png)

We can click to view the I&M again, and we will see that the I&M data has been successfully modified!

### PLC Programming and PNIO Control

First, we click on the left panel under Device -> PLC Logic -> Application -> PLC_PRG (PRG), and use ST language to program the variable and program code:

* **Variable Definition**: These variables define the input state of the button (in_pin_button_LED), the output state of the LED (out_pin_LED), and the state variable controlling whether the LED should blink (flashing). The oscillator state (oscillator_state) and oscillator cycle counter (oscillator_cycles) are used to achieve a timed blinking effect.

```st
PROGRAM PLC_PRG
VAR
    in_pin_button_LED: BOOL;
    out_pin_LED: BOOL;
    in_pin_button_LED_previous: BOOL;
    flashing: BOOL := TRUE;
    oscillator_state: BOOL := FALSE;
    oscillator_cycles: UINT := 0;
END_VAR
```

* **Program Definition**:
  1. First, in each cycle, the `oscillator_cycles` increases by 1. When the counter exceeds 200, the counter is reset, and the `oscillator_state` is toggled (TRUE or FALSE), achieving a periodic change.
  2. If the button is pressed (in_pin_button_LED is TRUE), and the button state in the previous cycle was FALSE, the `flashing` state is toggled. That is, every time the button is pressed, the LED blinking state is toggled.
  3. If `flashing` is TRUE, the LED will blink according to the oscillator state (`oscillator_state`). If `flashing` is FALSE, the LED will turn off directly.
  4. At the end of each cycle, the current button state is saved in `in_pin_button_LED_previous` to check the button press event in the next cycle.

```st
oscillator_cycles := oscillator_cycles + 1;
IF oscillator_cycles > 200 THEN 
    oscillator_cycles := 0;
    oscillator_state := NOT oscillator_state;
END_IF
IF in_pin_button_LED = TRUE THEN 
    IF in_pin_button_LED_previous = FALSE THEN 
        flashing := NOT flashing; 
    END_IF
    out_pin_LED := TRUE;
ELSIF flashing = TRUE THEN 
    out_pin_LED := oscillator_state;
ELSE 
    out_pin_LED := FALSE;
END_IF
in_pin_button_LED_previous := in_pin_button_LED;
```

The configuration in the project is shown in the image below:

![image-20241217154402755](figures/image-20241217154402755.png)

Next, we need to add a built-in IO module. Right-click on `P_Net_multi_module_sample_app` and add an IO module (DIO 8xLogicLevel), as shown in the image below:

![image-20241217154411140](figures/image-20241217154411140.png)

Then, double-click on the `DIO_8xLogicLevel` node, select the `PNIO Module I/O Mapping`, edit Input Bit 7 and Output Bit 7, and bind the PLC variables:

![image-20241217154418088](figures/image-20241217154418088.png)

Next, click on the **Build -> Generate Code** in the navigation bar, then select **Online -> Login**, and run to observe the behavior:

![image-20241217154427784](figures/image-20241217154427784.png)

Next, go back to CODESYS, double-click **Device -> PLC Logic -> Application** and open the `PLC_PRG (PRG)`. At this point, you can dynamically observe the program's running state. For example, if you press and hold the KEY0 on the EtherKit development board, you will find that both `in_pin_button_LED` and `in_pin_button_LED_previous` are FALSE. When you release KEY0, you will see that the `flashing` value toggles once.
